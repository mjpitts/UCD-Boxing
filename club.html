      <h1>Our Club Program</h1>
      <p>
        UC Davis Boxing Club accepts all possible members regardless of experience, age, gender, or physical shape and condition. Any person is able to join as long as an individual is eligible to fill out the sports club insurance waiver provided by UC Davis (see Insurance & Liability section) and is able to pay the quarterly dues or yearly dues ( $175 for the year, $65 for three days a week and $45 for two days a week). 

        Simply arrive at practice locations anytime during the first two weeks of a quarter and or before the sports club insurance is due. Attendees only need to come in workout clothes and comfortable shoes. Instruction into boxing will begin immediately.

      <h1>Gear:</h1>
      <p>
        UC Davis Boxing will provide you with all the equipment necessary to participate in our exercises. We will also provide headgear for sparring. We will NOT provide you with gloves, mouth pieces, or wraps. 
   
        You will have to purchase your own hand wraps and boxing gloves. We require 180” hand wraps and 16 oz or heavier gloves. 16 oz gloves and a personal mouthpiece are a requirement for sparring.
    
        Suggested locations to buy gloves and hand wraps within the Davis area are Big 5 and the ARC Proshop. These provide affordable gloves (~$30) and wraps (~$10) at the entry level. The equipment is lower quality, so do not expect it to last more than a couple quarters.
   
        Higher quality equipment can be found at the following recommended websites:
        (or under amazon warehouse for returned gear at a cheaper cost.)
