      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p> &emsp; UC Davis Boxing has been around since 2008. We started as a small club of dedicated individuals without formal structure and only an appreciation for the sport. After contacting and having coach Hector Lopez join the club, the club has since grown and become increasingly organized.The club was then joined by previous coach Kevin Wolfe and now coach Joel Stern. The UC Davis Boxing Club has been increasingly involved with the National Collegiate Boxing Association (NCBA) and United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association (USIBA) over the past few years. Only recently have we had an organized competitive team, which has been extremely successful in the collegiate boxing tournaments. We have produced three regional champions and one All-American boxer under the NCBA. We have also had three All-American boxers and three respective national champions recognized by the USIBA. While we pride ourselves in our competition group and our successes in tournaments under the collegiate sanctioning bodies, we pride ourselves more as an open UC Davis club sport. This means anybody with any amount of experience can join and participate within the club without the pressure of being forced to actively compete.
         
         &emsp; Members are allowed to devote as much time and energy to the club as they are willing, as little as attending just to stay in shape, or as ambitious as to attempt to become the next national champion. Despite misconceptions - you do not have to be hit in the face or anywhere when you’re in this club (unless you want to)!

    <h1>Coach: Joel Stern</h1>
    <p>
      Having grown up with boxing, coach Joel Stern has become immersed with the sport in more ways than one. Aside from coaching UC Davis Boxing for the last three years and having actively participated in the sport for eight - Joel writes and publishes articles on the sweet science. Becoming a head coach only recently, Joel has been an indispensable asset in creating the competition team, cornering Colin Schmitt in his NCBA Nationals and Mac Pham in his NCBA Regionals in 2013 and ‘14 respectively. In 2015, he also cornered Charles Wu and Azrael Nickens. Most recently he coached National Champion Vicky Zhao in both 2016 and 2017.
