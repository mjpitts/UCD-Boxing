      <h2>Typical Practice Structure</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="learn-more-about">
      <h2>Warm-Up</h2>
      <p>Time:(15 - 30 mins)
        The warm up will consist of 1 to 2 miles of jooging at the participant's own pace followed by ladder drills and jump-rope. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="learn-more-about">
      <h2>Mitt Work</h2>
      <p>Time:(45 - 60 mins)
        After the team completes the warm up there will be a short water break before mittwork begins. Mitt work will vary depending on skill level. For novice boxers The coaching staff will instruct you on how to throw punches properly, evad counter-punches, and hold mitts for your teammates. For more Advance boxers you will be given more free reign to pick and chose the combos you want to work with your partner.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="learn-more-about">
      <h2>Conditioning</h2>
      <p>Time:(15 - 30 mins)
        At the end of every practice all club members will be asked to participate in conditioning. Conditioning will very day to day, but will more than likely consist of sprints, burn-outs, and burpees. For those considering competing this will be the most important part of practice.

    <h2>Sparring (optional)</h2>
    <h4>Prereqs:
       At least 1 quarter of consistent training with the club, or an unusual amount of profeceincy with boxing.</h4>
  
      <p>
        Participating in sparring can happen one of two ways. If you would like to spar, please make your intentions clear early within the quarter. You can always approach officers and coaches at any time if you feel confident in participating in sparring. If a coach approves, then you will be able to begin sparring. 

        In the event that a coach notices ability or adherence to technique and instruction - you may be approached and asked to spar. This is completely optional and up to you.
