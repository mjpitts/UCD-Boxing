    <h2>How to Become a UC Davis Fighter</h2>
    <p>To compete, simply inform coaches of your intention to compete. Coaches must approve before enrolling a member to fight. Coaches may also often approach and bring up competing with members who show great potential. Competitors will have to fill out an application to become a USA Boxing approved boxer. Expect personal training and increased commitment to the sport. Competitive members will be given extra attention and more responsibilities in personal fitness and training.
      
      NOTE: Competitors are usually compensated for their training costs, travel costs, and lodging costs by the club.

      <h2>Why Do it?</h2>
      <p>UC Davis Boxing prides itself in competition and pushing its members to become the best possible athletes and boxers they can be. Competition is the epitome of excellence in the UC Davis Boxing sports club. Within the collegiate boxing community and the UC Davis community, there is prestige, titles, trophies, and pride to be gained from competition. Furthermore, participating in the competitive team will result in bonds of friendship and camaraderie that only a contact sport could provide. Becoming a boxer and stepping into the ring teaches discipline and tests an individual's ability to overcome adversity, however, the experience and character development is extremely rewarding.</p>
